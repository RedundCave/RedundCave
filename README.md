## What is RedundCave?

The “RedundCave” project aims to fully harness the potential of peer-to-peer networks by utilizing heterogeneous redundancy and edge storage technologies, providing robust security for user data. In this system, each user serves not only as a data storage node but also as a vital contributor to the overall network operation, enabling data to flow freely across a vast network of devices.
